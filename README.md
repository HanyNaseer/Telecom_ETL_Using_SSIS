# ETL Telecom

Data, resources, and tools, to help your business thrive. GSMA Services enable companies and organisations within the telecoms ecosystem to do business together more effectively. As well as to maintain the standards and reputation of the industry. Unique, accurate and comprehensive data underpin our services. Information, only a trade organization like the GSMA can collate. Especially, when it comes to device intelligence, since we manage the Type Allocation Code (TAC) system on behalf of the industry. The 8-digit TAC forms the first part of the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), which identifies each mobile device and its model specification. The first eight digits of an IMEI make up the Type Allocation Code (TAC). The TAC indicates the manufacturer and model of the particular device. So, all device models from a specific manufacturer will have the same TAC.

This project doesn't use fake datasets related to the field of communication (such as IMSI / IMEI / TAC / SNR), but I would like to highlight this project that reviews concepts and topics that can be applied in any other project, and the part of the field of Tele-communication in this series is extremely limited.
